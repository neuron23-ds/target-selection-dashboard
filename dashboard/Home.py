    # Target Selection Dashboard

    This dashboard was built to help facilitate the selection of new
    targets at Neuron23. By displaying all facets of data in one place,
    including genetic scores, biological function, and chemical druggability,
    we can  more easily select new targets in a data-driven way.\n
