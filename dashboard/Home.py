    Welcome to the Target Selection Dashboard!

    This was built to help facilitate the selection of new targets at Neuron23. 
    In it, you will find data on genetic scores, biological function, chemical druggability, and clinical information.
    This was built by the Data Science team in conjunction with both the Biology team and Chemistry team.\n

    See the "About" page for an explanation on how to use the dashboard and details on where information has been sourced from.

    **ðŸ‘ˆ  Click "Target Selection" on the sidebar to get started!**\n
